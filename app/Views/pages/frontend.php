                            JavaScript frameworks are tools you can use to automate tasks on a
                            website and improve general user experience (UX). They also offer faster
                            and more efficient ways of developing websites by providing highly scalable
                            and customizable components and modules to suit any app you want to build.

                            Although if you're a newcomer, jumping into JavaScript frameworks might be too technical for you, knowing more about them to make a potential choice is worth it. However, if you've been coding vanilla JavaScript for a while,
                            it might just be high time you added some of these frameworks to your skillset.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So, for learning purposes, let's take a look at a few JavaScript
                            frameworks you can pick up as a beginner.
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Vue.js
                                <p>
                                    Vue is a progressive JavaScript framework for building single-page
                                    applications (SPAs). It's a reactive framework that you can plug into
                                    an existing server-side language with minimum effort. If you're more
                                    interested in building progressive web apps (PWAs), then you might want
                                    to consider picking up Vue.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Vue comes with a command-line interface (CLI), which makes it easy to either
                                    add it to an existing project or start building one from the ground up. When
                                    executing a project with Vue, you can either install it via the <b>npm install</b>
                                    method or connect to its content delivery network (CDN) directly.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    With Vue, you can separate your DOM elements and treat them as separate entities
                                    in different files. Each entity then has its own CSS and JavaScript components.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    However, you can also develop your app more conventionally by <b>linking a whole
                                        DOM with its JavaScript and CSS file</b> and connecting to Vue's CDN.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
